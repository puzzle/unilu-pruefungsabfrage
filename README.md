### Code formatting in pre-commit hook
To have consistent code formatting in the entire project, the formatter-maven-plugin
is used. To ensure proper formatting, there is a pre-commit-hook that can be set up by
running the `setup-pre-commit` shell-script in the root directory. It will copy the
pre-commit script to the `.git/hooks` directory. Please note that this only works if you
don't already have such a script. In this case, either delete the old script or merge the contents
with the new script.

To change formatting preferences, you can export your formatting settings as eclipse
code formatter profile file, call it formatting(.xml) and replace the old config file in the
resources directory.
